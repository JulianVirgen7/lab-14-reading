## What did I learn about inline and block-level elements? 

I learned about inline elements and block-level elements. An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element. This is also known as a container.Â 

## What are the different link types?

I also learned about the different link types. Links can be used to establish and define the relationship between two documents. These links are <a>, <area>, and <link>.
